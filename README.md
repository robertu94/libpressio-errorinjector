# LibPressioErrorInjector

LibPressioErrorInjector provides a series of plugins for generating datasets and injecting errors into existing datasets

## Using LibPressioErrorInjector

Please see `./test/randomerror_example_c.c` for an example of the API.

## Getting Started

LibPressioErrorInjector provides three new major features on top of LibPressio:


+ `generate_random_data` io module which creates data buffers of the specified size when reading from random data
+ `generate_data_from_function` io module which creates data buffers of the specified size when reading
+ `inject_random_error` a meta-compressor which adds random noise according to a number of distributions to the data during compression

See [ErrorInjector Configuration](@ref optoptions) for more information on the configuration options.

## Dependencies

+ `cmake` version `3.13` or later
+ either:
  + `gcc-8.3.0` or later
  + `clang-9.0.0` or later
+ LibPressio version 0.40.1 or later


## Installing LibPressioErrorInjector using Spack

LibPressioErrorInjector can be built using [spack](https://github.com/spack/spack/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertu94/spack_packages robertu94_packages
spack repo add robertu94_packages
spack install libpressio-errorinjector
```

You can substantially reduce install times by not installing ImageMagick and PETSc support for libpressio.

```
spack install libpressio-errorinjector ^libpressio~magick~petsc
```


## Building and Installing LibPressioErrorInjector Manually

LibPressioErrorInjector uses CMake to configure build options.  See CMake documentation to see how to configure options

+ `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` - install the library to a local directory prefix
+ `BUILD_DOCS` - build the project documentation
+ `BUILD_TESTING` - build the test cases

```bash
BUILD_DIR=build
mkdir $BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR
cmake ..
make
make test
make install
```

To build the documentation:


```bash
BUILD_DIR=build
mkdir $BUILD_DIR
cd $BUILD_DIR
cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCS=ON
make docs
# the html docs can be found in $BUILD_DIR/html/index.html
# the man pages can be found in $BUILD_DIR/man/
```


## Stability

As of version 1.0.0, LibPressioErrorInjector will follow the following API stability guidelines:

+ The functions defined in files in `./include` are to considered stable
+ The functions defined in files or its subdirectories in `./include/libpressio_opt_ext/` considered unstable.

Stable means:

+ New APIs may be introduced with the increase of the minor version number.
+ APIs may gain additional overloads for C++ compatible interfaces with an increase in the minor version number.
+ An API may change the number or type of parameters with an increase in the major version number.
+ An API may be removed with the change of the major version number

Unstable means:

+ The API may change for any reason with the increase of the minor version number

Additionally, the performance of functions, memory usage patterns may change for both stable and unstable code with the increase of the patch version.


## Bug Reports

Please files bugs to the Github Issues page on the robertu94 github repository.

Please read this post on [how to file a good bug report](https://codingnest.com/how-to-file-a-good-bug-report/).Â  After reading this post, please provide the following information specific to LibPressioErrorInjector:

+ Your OS version and distribution information, usually this can be found in `/etc/os-release`
+ the output of `cmake -L $BUILD_DIR`
+ the version of each of LibPressioErrorInjectors's dependencies listed in the README that you have installed. Where possible, please provide the commit hashes.
